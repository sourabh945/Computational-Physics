# Computational-Physics
This is the repo of the Computational physics program using to solve the problem in physics and do physics simulation
---

This is the testing branch for the code here i make and test the new program and pull from the main branch.
All the code is not very stable and give any result all the program is under the development and any one can change in this branch.
